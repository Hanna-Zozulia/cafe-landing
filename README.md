## Getting Started

### Open directly

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Most functionality works without a local server.

### Run with a local server

For the most reliable behavior, especially for browser security restrictions and external embeds, serve the project directory with any static HTTP server. For example, with Python installed:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.

## Project Structure

```text
.
├── index.html       # Page structure and content
├── styles.css       # Layout, responsive styles, themes, and animations
├── script.js        # Menu tabs, modal, mobile navigation, and scroll behavior
├── img/             # Logo, hero image, interior photos, and gallery assets
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```

## Updating the Menu

The menu data is stored in the `MENU` object at the top of `script.js`. Each category contains a label and an array of items with a name, description, and price:

```js
breakfast: {
	label: "Breakfast",
	items: [
		{ n: "Dish name", d: "Short description", p: "7.20" }
	]
}
```

Update this object to change both the category preview and the full menu modal.

## Customization

- Change page text, navigation labels, contact details, and opening hours in `index.html`.
- Adjust colors, fonts, spacing, and breakpoints in the variables and rules in `styles.css`.
- Replace images in `img/` while keeping the filenames, or update the corresponding image paths in `index.html`.
- Update the Google Maps URLs in `index.html` when changing the cafe location.

## Browser Support

The page is designed for current versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. JavaScript uses standard browser APIs including `IntersectionObserver`, `matchMedia`, and `dataset`.
